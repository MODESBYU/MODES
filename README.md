# MODES

This is a repository made with the goal of being able to analyze data whether or not you are in CB 160.

Upload any spectra into the spectra folder, and don't forget to push commits before leaving the lab!
      - more organization will likely come later as we get more and more data and understand the RaptIR better

If you want a quick run down of Git/pulling/pushing the things you changed or added, talk to someone in the group who often deals with data.
